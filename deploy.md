# Vercel Deployment Instructions

If Vercel web interface is having issues, try these alternatives:

## Option 1: Manual Configuration
1. Clear browser cache and try again
2. Use incognito/private mode
3. Try different browser

## Option 2: Force Framework Detection
When stuck on framework selection:
1. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Or manually type: `Other` as framework

## Option 3: Netlify (Alternative)
If Vercel continues having issues, we can deploy to Netlify instead:
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Import from GitHub: akellylb/btrguestbook
3. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm install && npm start`
   - Publish directory: `public`

## Option 4: Railway (Alternative)
1. Go to railway.app
2. Connect GitHub repo
3. Deploy directly - usually works better with Node.js apps

The app is ready to deploy on any of these platforms!
